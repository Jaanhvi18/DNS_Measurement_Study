      ```


# TODO:
- [x] Collect results code
- [x] Collect results
- [x] Analysis code
  - [x] Initial analysis
  - [ ] Full resolvability check
- [ ] Visuals & output code estimate 2 days
- [ ] Visual & output â€” basically, free
- [ ] Write up paper

- Get updated resolver thing
- Ask about resolver diff functioning
- Implement/Ask about secondary check


## Instructions for duplicating our experiments:

## Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install pandas
```
```bash
pip3 install ipaddress
```
```bash
pip3 install matplotlib
```
```bash
pip3 install dns
```
```bash
import json
```
```bash
import csv
```
```bash
import argparser
```

## Scripts
* 

## All the python files 
* `resolver.py`
* `analysis.py`
* `result_visualization.py`


## All csv files after research is completed


## All visuals (png files) after research is completed


## Further Research
